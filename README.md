  <b>Winter Quarter 2021</b>
</p>

Hello there! This respository contains all .rmd files, data, and submitted homework for the Winter Quarter 2021 class Data Science for Biologists, or BIS15L. Please let me know if you have any feedback for me, I am always looking to improve.

## About Me
I am a Fourth Year Plant Biology student who has used R in the past, however at a more advanced level without the proper foundations -- I didn't understand why I was doing something, only that I had to do it. By taking this course, I am hoping to reinforce my shakey foundations to finally understand the coding I did so that I may replicate it independently.

I have a deep interest in understand abiotic effects and tolerance in plants, specifically in drought conditions. This interest has been awarded with a univeristy-funded grant, and I hope to use my new skills in analyzing my data. If the world were perfect, I'd love to pursue paleobotany and see how many more yet-to-be-discovered species are locked up in amber somewhere.
